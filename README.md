## Difficulty faced </br>
In this app, I made use of cookies for the user authentication and data fetching. Unfortunately, I do not own a custom domain, which is required for the deployed app to store the cookies. </br>
Thus in this case, we use localhost to test the app. For this frontend, we are using http://localhost:3000 . </br>
